Unix Project - Epitech

A group of philosophers has decided to start a new theory, dictating a group of rules
about sharing natural resources that prevents famishment around the world.<br>
Before the release of those rule, they decided testing it in a simulator. They hired you
to carry through this simulator and finally showing the whole world their infinite wisdom.<br>
On your shoulders is a huge responsibility : proving that your new friends have resolved
the famishment problem. In order to avoid the stress linked to the amount of risk
of this mission, youâ€™ll have to do this project by group of two persons.
