C++ Project - Epitech

The purpose of this project (on top of a tribute to our mess at the corner of the street) is to make you handle multi-process/multi-thread, through the simulation of a pizzeria with its kitchens. <br>
You will learn to manage various problems: load balancing, processes and threads synchronization, cook management etc.
